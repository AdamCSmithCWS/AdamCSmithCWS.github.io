## Adam C. Smith

I am a quantitative ecologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service, a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada. I am also an adjunct professor at Carleton University. 

My schooling is in biology and over the course of my graduate studies, I reluctantly transformed from a field biologist into a data-scientist/statistician. In my work for the Canadian Wildlife Service, I specialize in using broad-scale bird monitoring data (North American Breeding Bird Survey, Christmas Bird Count, eBird, shorebird migration surveys, etc.) to model changing bird populations and to investigate the causes behind those changes.
